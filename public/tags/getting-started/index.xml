      <description>Welcome to Multiple Regression! I&#39;m looking forward to working with you this semester, getting to know each of you and hopefully helping to expand your skills as emerging data scientists.
What are we doing in this course? I hope that by the end of the semester you will have a clear, confident identity as a regression modeller. Being able to work with data, fitting regression models, and being able to communicate what you did and what you found will be extremely valuable skills in quantitative-oriented work in your future.</description>
