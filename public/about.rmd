![](/291scatter_v03.png)

This intermediate-level statistics course develops skills in regression modelling. Our approach to learning regression modelling prioritizes more hands-on work fitting models with real-world data and less on mathematical proofs of the underlying estimators (consider Mathematical Statistics for that content).

The formal course description is:

>Theory and applications of regression techniques; linear and nonlinear multiple regression models, residual and influence analysis, correlation, covariance analysis, indicator variables and time series analysis. This course includes methods for choosing, fitting, evaluating and comparing statistical models and analyzes data sets taken from the natural, physical and social sciences. Prerequisite: one of a college-level introductory statistics course or the equivalent or a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics examination.

The course serves as a required course for the Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) major and minor, as well as in the applied statistics track of the math major. For more information on how the course fits within the SDS curriculum, see the [SDS website.](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics)
